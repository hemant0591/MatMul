# MatMul
Matrix multiplication from scratch

We're trying out matrix multiplication from scratch progressively building better and faster methods in following steps:
1. Using pure python for loops
2. Using Numba njit
3. Using Numpy broadcasting rules
4. Pytorch's Einstein summation
5. Implementing CUDA kernel to use GPU acceleration
